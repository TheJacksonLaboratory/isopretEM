# isopretEM

Isoform Interpretation by Expectation Maximization (isopretEM) is a method for infering isoform specific functions based on the relationship between sequence and functional isoform similarity. 


## Running isopretEM

Three R scripts are provided

##  gold-standard isoform-specific dataset
We reviewed the literature for papers that determine the function of isoform that can be mapped to Ensembl IDs and whose function can be mapped to GO terms, resulting in a collection of 307 examples where an isoform was shown to be either associated with a certain GO term or not associated with it. 


## Citing isopretEM

A preprint is available as [Karlebach et al., An algorithmic framework for isoform-specific functional analysis](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.13.491897v1). A manuscript version is currently in review.
